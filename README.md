# Footprint_Analysis
Project to develop a dashboard to track total impact on the environment from purchases and actions.
For now I would like to look at the followin key functions of being a person and see how to best track this data;
  1) Food
  2) Travel
  3) Accomodation
  4) Work
  5) Free time

I'll add more to this as I explore the available data.
